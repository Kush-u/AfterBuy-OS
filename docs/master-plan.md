# AfterBuy — Master Plan

Version 1.0 · 21 September 2026

AfterBuy is a multi-tenant Telegram reseller platform. The owner sells digital products (ebooks, handwritten notes) through their own Telegram bot. Resellers connect their own Telegram bots, prepay a USDT wallet via admin-generated top-up tokens, and sell the owner's products to their own customers.

This document is the product and engineering plan. Phase 0 implements only repository setup, scaffolding, environment configuration, module skeletons, fake adapters, and the database foundation. Later phases must not be pulled forward.

## Money and tenancy invariants

- Currency at launch is USDT only. Amounts are integer minor units with 6 decimal places (`1 USDT = 1_000_000`).
- Ledger rows are append-only. Corrections are new reversal entries.
- Tenant IDs used in queries come from the authenticated session, never from the request body.
- Prices are calculated server-side. Client and bot submitted prices are ignored.
- Order and wallet mutations require idempotency keys.
- Bot webhooks validate `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` from Phase 4 onward.

## System shape

- **App:** Next.js 14 App Router on Vercel
- **Auth / DB / Storage / Queues:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, private Storage, pgmq)
- **Bots:** grammY behind `/api/webhooks/telegram/[botId]`
- **Payments:** Binance Pay and USDT BEP20, sandbox-first
- **Reseller API:** `/api/v1` in Phase 7

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Foundation (this phase)

Repository structure, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind, Vitest, env templates, Supabase clients, domain module skeletons, sandbox Binance/BSC/Telegram adapters, initial SQL schema, health endpoint, webhook stub.

Exit: `type-check`, `test`, `build`, and `lint` pass; health route returns ok; no secrets in git.

### Phase 1 — Identity and tenants

Supabase Auth for owner, staff, and resellers. Invitations. Profile roles. Dashboard middleware that actually gates routes. Tenant records for resellers only (owner has no tenant row).

### Phase 2 — Catalog and pricing

Owner product CRUD, private Storage assets, reseller listings with server-side retail prices, wholesale snapshots.

### Phase 3 — Wallet and top-up tokens

Persist wallets and the append-only ledger. Admin 12-digit top-up tokens. Reservation and wholesale debit in a database transaction.

### Phase 4 — Telegram bots

grammY webhook processing, encrypted bot tokens, customer records, owner store bot and reseller bots, secret-token enforcement.

### Phase 5 — Payments

Live Binance Pay and BEP20 verification. Payment claims, order payment track, refund/dispute stubs with audit logging.

### Phase 6 — Fulfillment and delivery

File delivery from private Storage, manual queue, supplier connector calls, delivery attempts to Telegram or API, independent fulfillment/delivery tracks.

### Phase 7 — Public reseller API

Versioned `/api/v1` with API keys, idempotent order create, and documented error shapes.

## Out of scope until named

- Fiat currencies and FX
- Real payout automation beyond the USDT wallet model
- Multi-owner marketplaces
- Customer-facing web checkout (Telegram and API are the channels)
